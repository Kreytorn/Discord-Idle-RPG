## Discord Idle RPG
Idle RPG bot

## How to Use?
### Prerequisites
Create a server in Discord and add the Idle RPG bot to your server. Use this link to add the bot.
Create a Discord bot and add it to the server. If you're unsure how to create one, watch the first 2 minutes of this video.
Obtain the Token of the bot you created.
Install Python 3.7 or any other interface where you can write Python code. Download Python.

## Instructions
Copy and paste the provided code.
Replace "TYPE YOUR TOKEN HERE" with your bot's Token.
Install the required packages listed at the top of the code (those starting with import).
Follow these instructions to install packages.
Run the code.

## Usage
Set the money x variable to the amount you want to play with. It's recommended to divide your money by 35000 and play with that amount. For example:

```
money_x = 10
flip(10)
you lost
flip(20)
you lost
flip(40)
you won
(then back to 10)
flip(10)
```

- Wait for the code to print "We have logged into (yourbot)" before using the bot in your server.

- Open your server and type flip(10) to use the bot.

- To stop the bot, simply stop the code. To restart, follow steps 6-7-8-9.
