This is a code that helps you make infinitife money on idle discord rpg.


https://invite.idlerpg.xyz this link is the idle rpg bot.

What does the code do?
The code that I have written makes infinitife money for you.
How do I use the code? Lets take a look at what you need to do:

1. Create a server in Discord and add IDLE RPG bot to your server. (https://invite.idlerpg.xyz/) Use the link to add the bot.
2. Create a discord bot. If you don't know how to create one, check first 2 minutes of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqurhm2QxA0 
3. Get the Token of the bot you created.
4. Open an interface where you can write python code. Such as python 3.7 or idle python. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
5. Copy paste the code that I shared.
6. Change the TOKEN to your bots Token (At the end of the code you will see "TYPE YOUR TOKEN HERE"
7. install the packages that are at the top of the code the ones that start with import
7. Check here to learn how to install https://docs.netapp.com/oci-73/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.netapp.doc.oci-ht-all%2FGUID-B91E7C76-5651-4216-A4FD-000A7BBAA98E.html 
8. Run the code.
9.
The money x:
Money x is the amount you want to play with.
I would recommend you to divide your money with 35000 and play with that
Example:
the money x = 10

flip(10)
you lost
flip(20)
you lost
flip(40)
you won
(than back to 10)
flip(10)
. . .

10. After you choose the money x wait till the code prints  " we have logged into (yourbot)"
11. Then open the server that you host and type flip(10) and it will work.
12. When you want bot to stop just stop the code. If you want to restart just follow steps 6-7-8-9.

Enjoy!
